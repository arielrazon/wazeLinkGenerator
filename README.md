# Waze Deep Link Generator

This app takes addresses and converts them into a URL that can open the waze app right on a user's phone. This was inspired by needing to copy and paste map links between my calendar/notes app and Waze when syncing calendar events from my PC. Apple calendars only opens apple maps for directions. 

##Version 1 - node

Version 1 was built as an NPM command line app for proof-of-concept purposes.
